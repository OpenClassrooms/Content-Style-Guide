## People ##
**Learners**
: We call the people studying our courses **Learners** rather than using terms like students.

**Educators**
: Our courses are designed and led by academics or professionals with appropriate expertise and experience in the topic. An Educator might be a _Professor_ or hold other academic rank which adds to their authority, but to us they are an Educator.

**Authors**
: Authors design, write and produce Course content, but are _otherwise anonymous_. Instead, we favour talking about Educators as being the "face" of the course; a learner should not be confronted with the confusing combination of both terms, and as such, we don't use the term Author in learner-facing text.

**Mentors**
: Mentors work with groups of learners with Premium Class.

**Tutors**
: Tutors may also be Mentors, but are acting in a private, 1-2-1 context with a Premium Plus subscriber.
