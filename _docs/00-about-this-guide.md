title: About this guide
---
This is a _living document_. A dynamic, evolving snapshot of how we as OpenClassrooms talk to our learners and the public through our content.

As our product develops, the guide will develop alongside it. Because of this, it is important that we make changes to it in an _atomic_ fashion maintaining a record of the accompanying narrative explaining the purpose, motivation and rational for those changes. To support this way of working, we store the guide in a GitHub repository allowing anyone at OpenClassrooms to access the commit history and see our evolving world.

The intention is for the following guidance to be applied to our product, our content and our marketing. While we respect and value the _voice_ of our educators and the distinct style with which each communicate their knowledge, it is important that some principles remain consistent. For instance, we would prefer our educators to refer to learners as learners and present dates in the consistent pattern defined here. It is our _language_, but their _accent_.
