title: Talking about our Courses
---

## Course information pages ##
The first exposure to our courses learners will likely encounter will be a **Course Information page**. The main purpose of this information should be to allow the learner to make more informed decisions about learning. When done well, this should also serve the business desirable-goal of encouraging more learners to sign up to courses (and hopefully premium services).

When writing descriptive copy, we should aim--in few and compelling words--to articulate answers to these questions:

- What is the need/headache this course meets?
- What is the context of the course or subject - why is it important?
- How does this fit in a broader learning journey? (and perhaps path)

For example:

```en
JavaScript is the most common entry point into the world of front-end web development. Whenever you see terms like Angular, Node, jQuery or React, you are seeing technologies building on the same basic language.

This course will introduce fundamental concepts in programming like functions, objects, variables and conditionals that you’ll need to succeed in learning any programming language, and introduce ideas that will start you on the path of developing dynamic, powerful web applications. It’s a great stepping stone into our Front-end Developer Path, or a refresher for people about to jump into studying other programming languages.

If you have never tried programming before or been put off learning by steep learning curves and long setup time, JavaScript is a fantastic way to get going quickly without even leaving your web browser.
```

## Learning Outcomes ##
Courses (and Paths) can be more formally described through _Learning Outcomes_. These articulate what a learner will be able to do through completion of the course. In addition to offering a very succinct view of the learning, they also help define equivalence between our courses and those from other providers. For instance, a learner may use these to apply for exception from part of a module in a taught programme.

```en
By the end of this course you’ll be able to:

Describe and interpret simple Javascript programs.
Use and manipulate variables.
Solve simple problems using functions, conditionals and looping.
```

The verb-first outcome is fairly standard across HE as a descriptor for learning outcomes. The only real catch is trying to avoid describing learning with verbs like “understand”, or “learn”; as outcomes, these are problematic as it is unclear what the learner is supposed to be able to do with their ‘understanding’ - do we expect them to be able to explain the concept? To apply the process? Or reflect on it? Picking one of these more purposeful verbs can often result in a better defined view of what the course is offering.

## How will I learn? ##
While this might seem obvious on MOOCs (e.g. watching videos and submitting assignments), it would be helpful to clarify it in each course. For instance, do I need to write code? Or is this purely theoretical? Will we work with real-life business case-studies? Or will it hold my hand through starting my own company?

## What do I need to succeed? ##
We should identify any prerequisites (specifically in knowledge) and help learners understand whether they meet them, and wherever possible, show people how they might re-mediate these gaps. For instance, we might suggest an introductory programming course for learners wishing to study a more advanced or specific one.

Technical requirements are important, but we only need to make something of them when they go beyond what learners need to access the course. For instance, if they will need to install a tool-chain like Android Studio, we should tell them upfront - and reassure them that there will be guidance in the course.

## Where next? ##
With OC’s priorities, we should be highlighting courses both as entry points into careers, and Paths in as flexible a way as possible; unless there is a specific sequencing requirement, is there a potential logical pathway from each entry point (e.g. “once you’ve learnt the basics…”; “next, revisit the basics…”)
